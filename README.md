# Name-Entity-Recognition
### Applied LSTM to extract entities from the text such as person, name, organisation etc from Twitter Dataset

Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. 

A solution of the task will be based on neural networks, particularly, on Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTMs).
